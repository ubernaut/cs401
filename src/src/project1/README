Breadth First works great when it doesn't run out of memory!

itDeepSearch gets caught in a cycle;

both A* functions calculate cost correctly.  the States are stored inside a TreeSet to ensure no duplicate states exist. SlideBoard implements the comparable function to facilitate this. when two states have an equal cost, it triggers a more rigourus analysis of the set to determine if they are the same State. 

unfortunately, both A* functions get caught inside cycles fairly quickly.
